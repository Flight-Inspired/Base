# Money Matters

I just converted everything to be in react.
In the ./frontend folder you will find the entire client side of the app.

To start the app perform:

    cd frontend

    npm start

The server side is all the same as Eddie had, in Python using flask. You can find it in the ./backend folder

To start the server perform:

    cd backend

    python app.py
